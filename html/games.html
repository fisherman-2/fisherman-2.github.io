            <img src="../static/img/terraria-logo.png" alt="Terraria Logo" class="game-logo" width="400" height="200">
            <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">This is one of my favorite games of ALL time. I have roughly 1000 hours in this games and still to this day i can play it. This is a game where its a 2d open world rpg game where you fight bosses and grind. I first played this game when i was like around 7 on my cousins laptop. I have this game on all my consoles to like pc, phone, wii u, and even my 3ds. Their is also a infinte universe of modding for this with the tmodloader and it SUPER easy its litterly on steam itself. Also some great music. worth every penny.</p>
